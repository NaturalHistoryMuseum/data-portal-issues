# Data Portal Issue Tracker
This repository collects issues for the Natural History Museum (London)'s [Data Portal](https://data.nhm.ac.uk/).

The Data Portal is made up of a number of CKAN extensions and services and therefore this repository provides a central place for issues to be made against the site in general.

From here issues might be moved to their relevant projects (e.g. [ckanext-nhm](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/ckanext-nhm)), but most will remain here until resolved.

Content, data content and question issues stay in this repository until addressed.

_It is our goal that issues in this repository are addressed and closed and no issues remain open._

## Flow

The user creates an issue and classifies it as well as they can with either: bug, content, question or idea.
